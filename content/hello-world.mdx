# My Journey as a Frontend Developer — Learning, Building, and Growing

Every developer’s path is unique, shaped by experiences, projects, and the people they meet along the way. I’d like to share mine — a journey full of learning, hands-on practice, and the drive to turn ideas into real applications.

---

My real development journey began in **2022**, when I started working with **React Native**. I was fascinated by the ability to create cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and a single codebase. That early passion turned into something concrete when I worked on my university **Final Year Project** — a **University Social App** built using React Native, where I learned how to transform design into real functionality.

After completing my degree in **2023**, I sharpened my skills further with modern JavaScript and React. I joined **CodSoft** as an intern, where I got the chance to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, improve my coding practices, and understand the importance of writing scalable and maintainable code.

Once the internship wrapped up, I fully transitioned into **MERN stack development**, working on full-stack projects and strengthening both my frontend and backend skills. Later, I joined **Trade Tracker**, where I worked on **three live websites** — from designing one project from scratch to creating reusable components and improving the performance of ongoing projects.

In **January 2025**, I took on one of my most challenging and exciting roles: working on a large-scale application, the **EccountBook ERP System App**. This experience taught me how enterprise-grade apps are structured, how to work in larger teams, and how crucial clean architecture and consistency are when working at scale.

I also had the opportunity to work as a **Junior Frontend Developer** on contract for **Siemens Energy**, where I was part of a talented team focused on creating clean, efficient frontend solutions. This contract lasted 6 months and gave me exposure to real corporate workflows, agile methodologies, and large codebases.

Throughout this journey, I’ve worked with a wide range of tools and technologies:

- **React.js / React Native**
- **React Query**
- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript & JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Angular**
- **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**
- **HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, AntDesign**
- **Jest for testing**
